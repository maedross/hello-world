This program takes greets the user and calculates their age. One must enter a decimal number as there birth year to get correct output. "Nineteen ninety-five" would not be an acceptable response. This is what the user can expect as output:
```
Welcome to my greeting program!
What is your name? <user enters name here>
What year were you born? <user enters birth year here>
Hello <name>, you're <current_year-birth_year> years old this year!
```
