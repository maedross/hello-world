This program greets the user and calculates their age. One must enter a decimal number as their birth year to get correct output. "Nineteen ninety-five" would not be an acceptable response. This is what the user can expect as output:
```
Welcome to my greeting program!
What is your name? <user enters name here>
What year were you born? <user enters birth year here>
Hello <name>, you're <current_year-birth_year> years old this year!
```
## Licensing and Code of Conduct Explanation
We went with the MIT License because it is a very popular, permissive license for free and open source projects. It also specifies that modified pieces of the software should include a copy of this license to emphasize the importance of software that can be read, copied, and modified by any user. It also limits the liability for the author. We chose the Contributor Covenant because it communicates the idea that open source development is a pro-social process that flourishes when contributors have mutual respect for each other and the work that they do. It pursues an environment free of harassment, bullying, and personal attacks.
